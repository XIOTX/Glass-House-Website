# Glass House Animation - MAJOR FIXES COMPLETE! 🎉

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED & DEPLOYED
- [x] **Animation repeating after first fill** → FIXED with transitionStarted flag
- [x] **Only works after second cycle** → FIXED with proper completion detection
- [x] **Auto scroll to top** → FIXED with precise scroll-up detection (only at scrollY === 0)
- [x] **Content pops in** → FIXED - content now visible during header transition

## 🌐 LIVE & READY FOR TESTING
**Deployed:** https://same-j4uos7bgbag-latest.netlify.app

## 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS
Test these specific behaviors:
- [ ] **Single animation run** - Logo illuminates once, transitions to content (no repeating)
- [ ] **Content during transition** - Page content visible underneath sliding header
- [ ] **Scroll-up reset** - At top of page, scroll up to smoothly return to black animation
- [ ] **Header catches** - Header slides up and stays fixed at top during normal scrolling

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED
- Added `transitionStarted` flag to prevent animation loops
- Content shows immediately when transition begins (positioned under header)
- Improved scroll-up detection with proper event listener cleanup
- Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps transitions
- Fixed event handling to prevent unwanted auto-scroll triggers

## 🎯 TARGET BEHAVIOR ACHIEVED
✅ Logo animates → header slides up revealing content → header catches at top
✅ Content always visible during transition, positioned correctly
✅ Scroll-up only triggers when at very top of completed page
